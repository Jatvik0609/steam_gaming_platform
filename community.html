            <h5>Steam is a video game digital distribution service and storefront by Valve. It was launched as a
                software client in September 2003 as a way for Valve to provide automatic updates for their games, and
                expanded to distributing and offering third-party game publishers' titles in late 2005. Steam offers
                various features, like digital rights management (DRM), game server matchmaking, anti-cheat measures,
                social networking and game streaming services. It provides the user with automatic game updating, saved
                game cloud synchronization, and community features such as friends messaging, in-game chat and a
                community market.

                Valve released a freely available application programming interface (API) called Steamworks in 2008,
                which developers can use to integrate Steam's functions into their products, including in-game
                achievements, microtransactions, and user-created content support. Initially developed for Microsoft
                Windows operating systems, Steam was released for macOS in 2010 and Linux in 2012. Mobile apps to access
                online Steam features were first released for iOS and Android in 2012. The platform also offers other
                digital content and Valve gaming hardware, including productivity software, game soundtracks, videos and
                VR headset Valve Index. </h5>
